Runs a single-player battleship game to be played in the terminal against an AI opponent run by an algorithm based on the calculated probability of each move. Utilizes the Model View Controller design pattern and a proxy controller to facilitate the ability to connect to an external socket which processes JSONs to participate in a class-wide tournament between students' AIs. Has two modes: one which allows a user to play against the AI and one which allows the AI to play against other AIs via an external socket. Coded in Java and uses JSONS, Gradle, and JUnit testing.
